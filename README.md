Interactive Analysis of Global Energy Production Trends
This project delves into the ever-evolving landscape of global energy production. It leverages a rich dataset spanning 14 years and encompassing various energy sources – coal, natural gas, and renewables – across eight countries. To make this data readily accessible and interactive, an R Shiny application has been developed.

This user-friendly application empowers researchers and policymakers to gain deeper insights into global energy trends. Users can leverage the application to:

Visualize trends: Explore how energy production patterns have shifted over the past 14 years for each source and country. This allows for a clear understanding of how energy dependence is evolving across the globe.
Compare energy mixes: Gain valuable insights into the energy mix of different countries. By comparing the contribution of various sources to a nation's overall energy production, users can identify trends towards cleaner energy sources or continued reliance on traditional fuels.
This interactive analysis tool is a valuable asset for anyone interested in understanding the complexities of global energy transitions.  It provides researchers with a platform to explore and analyze data, potentially leading to groundbreaking discoveries in energy production and consumption patterns. Policymakers can utilize the application's insights to inform data-driven decisions that promote sustainable energy practices on a national and international scale.
